##                API
An API is an application programming interface.
It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other.
The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it.


##        REST API
REST determines how the API looks like.
It stands for “Representational State Transfer”.
It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API.
One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL.

REpresentational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.
REST API is a way of accessing the web services in a simple and flexible way without having any processing.





                                        'SOAP API vs REST API'


SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol and REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.
Since SOAP is a protocol, it follows a strict standard to allow communication between the client and the server
whereas REST is an architectural style that doesn’t follow any strict standard but follows six constraints defined by Roy Fielding in 2000.
Those constraints are – Uniform Interface, Client-Server, Stateless, Cacheable, Layered System, Code on Demand.


SOAP uses only XML for exchanging information in its message format whereas REST is not restricted to XML and its the choice of implementer
which Media-Type to use like XML, JSON, Plain-text. Moreover, REST can use SOAP protocol but SOAP cannot use REST.
