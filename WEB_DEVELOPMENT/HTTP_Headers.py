##                    HEADERS

->HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response.

->Headers can be grouped according to their contexts:

1.General headers apply to both requests and responses, but with no relation to the data transmitted in the body.

2.Request headers contain more information about the resource to be fetched, or about the client requesting the resource.

3.Response headers hold additional information about the response, like its location or about the server providing it.

4.Entity headers contain information about the body of the resource, like its content length or MIME type.
