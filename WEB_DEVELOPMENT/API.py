What is an API?

Application Program Interface

APIs are a set of functions and procedures that allow for the creation of applications that access data and
features of other applications, services, or operating systems.

According to Wikipedia, good APIs make it easier to develop a computer program by providing all the building blocks,
which are then put together by the programmer.”

So, what exactly is an API?
An application program interface (API) is a toolset that programmers can use to help them create software. Simply put,
an API specifies how software components should interact.


##A real-world example
A real-world example is buying movie tickets online. You go to the movie site; you enter your movie, name and credit card information,
and lo-and-behold, you print out your tickets. But what’s going on between entering your information to receiving your ticket? APIs, that’s what!

They are collaborating behind the scenes with other applications. How is this possible you ask? This type of integration is called “seamless”
because you never have a clue when a software role is passed from one application to another.
