An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the users web browser.
The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server. Typically, its used to tell if
two requests came from the same browser — keeping a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information
for the stateless HTTP protocol.

Cookies are mainly used for three purposes:

1.Session management
Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember

2.Personalization
User preferences, themes, and other settings

3.Tracking
Recording and analyzing user behavior



##                            How cookies are used in a website?
'What are cookies?'

Cookies are small files which are stored on a user’s computer.
They are used to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website and can be accessed
either by the web server or by the client computer.

When cookies were invented, they were basically little documents containing information about you and your preferences.
For instance, when you select your language in which you want to view your website, the website would save the information in a
document called a cookie on your computer, and the next time when you visit the website, it would be able to read a cookie saved earlier.
That way the website could remember your language and let you view the website in your preferred language without having to select the language again.
A cookie can contain any type of information such as the time when you visited the website, the items that you added into your shopping basket,
all the links you clicked in website, etc.,

'Who can access?'

If a cookie is created in a particular website, and you visit another website later, the latter would not be able to read the contents from the first website,
in other words only the same website that saves information to a cookie can access it.



'Types of internet Cookies'

##Session Cookies:

A session cookie only lasts for the duration of users using the website. A web browser normally deletes session cookies when it quits.
A session cookie expires if the user does not access the website for a period of time chosen by the server(idle timeout).
They only last for the duration of time we are on the site. If someone comes and uses our computer, they would not be able to see anything
on the sites that use session cookies, because they need to enter the username and password again.

##HTTP Cookies:

When you send a request to the server, the server sends a reply in which it embeds the cookie which serves as an identifier to identify the user.
So, next time when you visit the same website, the cookie lets the server know that you are visiting the website again.
