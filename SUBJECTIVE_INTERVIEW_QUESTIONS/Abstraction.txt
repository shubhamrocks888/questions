#Abstraction in OOP. 

Abstraction is defined as a work of art where the subject or theme is implied.

		'OR'

Objects in an OOP language provide an abstraction that hides 
the internal implementation details. Similar to the coffee machine in your kitchen, 
you just need to know which methods of the object are available to call and which input 
parameters are needed to trigger a specific operation.



#Abstraction using Classes: 

We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. 
Class helps us to group data members and member functions using available access specifiers. 
A Class can decide which data member will be visible to outside world and which is not.
