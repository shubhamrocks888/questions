Q:   What is Encapsulation?

Ans: Encapsulation is an Object Oriented Programming concept that binds together the data and functions 
     that manipulate the data, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. 
     
     The best example of encapsulation could be a calculator.



Encapsulation is referred to one of the following two notions.
1) Data hiding: A language feature to restrict access to members of an object. For example, private and protected members in C++.


2) Bundling of data and methods together: Data and methods that operate on that data are bundled together.
