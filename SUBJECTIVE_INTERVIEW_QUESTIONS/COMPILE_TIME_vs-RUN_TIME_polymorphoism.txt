#Compile Time Polymorphism: 

->Whenever an object is bound with their functionality at the compile-time, this is known as the compile-time polymorphism.
Example: Method overloading



#Run-Time Polymorphism:

 Whenever an object is bound with the functionality at run time, this is known as runtime polymorphism. 
 The runtime polymorphism can be achieved by method overriding.
